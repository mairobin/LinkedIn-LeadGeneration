FOLLOWER/CONNECTION EXTRACTION RULES (STRICT):

- Only extract if the number appears in the same phrase as one of: "followers", "Follower", "connections", "Kontakte" (or clear variants like "more than X followers", "über X Follower"). If not explicitly present, set the field to null.
- Preserve the original formatting of the number (keep "+" or "K", decimals, thousand separators/localization).
- Acceptable examples:
  - "1K followers"
  - "4540 Follower"
  - "2.5K followers"
  - "500+ connections"
  - "1K+ Kontakte"
  - "5000 connections"
- Do NOT extract from:
  - Numbers related to likes, views, impressions, mutual connections, company/page followers, or groups.
  - Standalone numbers without the follower/connection keyword nearby.
  - Hearsay text, summaries, or third-party descriptions without explicit counts.
- If multiple explicit counts appear, prefer the one in the profile header/top section; otherwise, use the first explicit mention.

COMPANY WEBSITE RULES:

1. Prefer the user given website and avoid generic website.
2. Exclude LinkedIn, Wikipedia, social networks, and job boards.
3. If multiple candidate domains exist, choose the non-generic one.
4. If unsure, set company_website to null.

Return only the JSON object. Do not include explanations.
